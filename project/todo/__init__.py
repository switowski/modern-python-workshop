"""By creating this file, we turn "todo" directory into a Python package.

# Set up Flask and sqlite database
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI"] = "sqlite:///todo.db"
# The following line is needed to suppress SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS warning
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS"] = True

# This import has to be AFTER the "app" and "db" setup!
# Otherwise you will run into circular imports issues
